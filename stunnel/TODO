stunnel         Universal SSL tunnel for daemons invoked by inetd

1. Add -r remote mode to connect to remote unencrypted service
   instead of spawning a process.

2. Add -s stand-alone mode to work without inetd as a separate
   daemon.

3. If possible add certificate signed by a thrusted CA.
   If not -> build a web page to add new certificate to browser.

4. Make stunnel compatible with M$ products.
