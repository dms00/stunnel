stunnel         Universal SSL tunnel for daemons invoked by inetd

Short description

     The stunnel program is designed to intercept  incoming  con-
     nections  to  particular  daemons started by inetd(8) super-
     deamon and perform SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) handshake with
     the  peer.  After  succesful  handshake any incoming data is
     passed to the daemon in unencrypted form. Any outgoind  data
     produced  by  the  daemon  and  written  to  the  network is
     encrypted.

     stunnel can be used to add  SSL  functionality  to  commonly
     used  inetd  daemons  like  POP-2,  POP-3  and  IMAP servers
     without any changes in the programs' code.
