stunnel         Universal SSL tunnel

1. If your machine supports POSIX threads make sure your SSL
   library is compiled with -DTHREADS.

2. Compile the software:

        ./configure
        make
        make install

   If you have problems with Internet Domain implementation of
   make_sockets() change line:

       #define INET_SOCKET_PAIR 1

   in file stunnel.h to be:

       #define INET_SOCKET_PAIR 0

   and repeat:

       make
       make install

3. Test with ./stunnel -f -d <ssl-port> -r <remote-service>:<remote-port>

4. Install daemon in your startup file (daemon mode).

     or

   Modify /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf, restart inetd (inetd mode).

   See stunnel manual for details.
